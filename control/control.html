        nose
    </button>
    
    <div class="modal modal1">
        I have always been self-conscious about my nose. It's so triangular with a droop down slope, which is narrow.
        Although I wished to have had a nose that was smaller, I grew to appreciate my nose for its form. It's clear evidence of my Bolivian descent, which I appreciate and love. 
        For my ancestors loved one another.

    <button class="btn btn2">
        eyes
    </button>
    
    <div class="modal modal2">
    Something I do appreciate about myself is my eyes. I know they a little bigger than the "standard," but they stand out to me.
    When I was younger I wished I had lighter eyes. My pupils are dark-brown and practically blend into my pupils. 
    They remind me of a dark hole in which I got lost in fixation.

    <button class="btn btn3">
        lips
    </button>
    <div class="modal modal3">
        I have always judged my lips by htinking they are thin and small whereas plump lips are appreciated and valued.
        My lips are small but a little full. It's the same width as my nose.

     <button class="btn btn4">
        teeth
    </button>
        
    <div class="modal modal4">
        My teeth have been all over the place for most of my life. I have had an overbite and my teeth spreap like flower pedals blooming.
        Even after braces, my teeth shifted due to my carelessness, but even when my teeth were freshly adjusted after braces, there was still a gap. 
        No matter how much they changed, the gap always remained.
